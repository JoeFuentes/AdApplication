# AdApplication

This is a very simple application to run

Simply open the ads.html file in your browser (mobile or otherwise).

ads.css contains some basic media queries to handle a few mobile devices and it overrides a few bootstrap classes.

adApp.js contains the Angular code with the controller and the service as per the requirement.

I did not have time to get the data into a real database so I simple created mock data for the purposes of the demo

Thanks
